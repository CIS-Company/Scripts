# Scripts

Scripts used to automate the deployment process of the project, which can include provisioning the required AWS resources, deploying the code, configuring the services and performing attacks.


Create a basic README.md file within the repo that contains the names of all the members and a description of the script including the WHAT and WHY.
Please list any resources or references used in creating the script here as well.
Commit the script in it’s own file and link it to the README.md file.
Don’t forget to leave comments in your code!
